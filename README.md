# Text Style Transfer: TBD
Implement techniques in NLP that allow for the transformation of text from one style to another while retaining the original contentâ€™s meaning.

# Initial Proposal:
The paper [ParaDetox: Detoxification with Parallel Data](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.469.pdf) provides a pipeline for collecting parallel data for the detoxification task. 

This paper's contributors collect non-toxic paraphrases for over 10,000 English toxic sentences. 

It shows that this pipeline can be used to distill a large existing corpus of paraphrases to get toxic-neutral sentence pairs.

[The code is open-sourced](https://github.com/s-nlp/paradetox), which allows us to look through its mechanisms. The relevant dataset is also available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/s-nlp/paradetox).

From the paper, models including but not only `CondBERT, ParaGeDi, DRG-Template/Retrieve` have been tested. Therefore, for this project, we could potentially work on [T5 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03802), where a [hands-on tutorial](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/tutorials/t5_demo.html) is available.
